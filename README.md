Developed a sensor hub which transmits data to a mobile app through BLE. The sensor hub is controlled by EFM32 Leopard Gecko micro-controller, Temperature sensor, Ambient Light sensor, Accelerometer, Capacitive touch sensor and the BLE is a ATMEL SAMB11 which data through UART and transmits to a mobile application.
